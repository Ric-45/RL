# Dynamic Resource Allocation in Multi-Cloud Environments Using Reinforcement Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of my M.Sc. Cloud Computing thesis project:  
**"Dynamic Resource Allocation in Multi-Cloud Environments Using Reinforcement Learning"**.

The project focuses on solving real-time resource allocation and load balancing challenges across multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Develop an adaptive algorithm for optimal resource allocation across multi-cloud environments.
- Improve performance and reduce operational costs.
- Minimize latency and network overhead while respecting data sovereignty regulations.

---

## 🧰 Dataset Information

The dataset was generated/simulated from multi-cloud environments and includes:

- CPU Usage  
- Memory Usage  
- Network Traffic  
- Power Consumption  

Metrics were collected from **3 different Virtual Machines (VMs)** hosted across multiple cloud platforms.
