# Dynamic Resource Allocation in Multi-Cloud Environments Using Reinforcement Learning
As part of my M.Sc. in Cloud Computing, I worked on a thesis project titled "Dynamic Resource Allocation in Multi-Cloud Environments Using Reinforcement Learning". The primary goal was to develop an adaptive algorithm capable of optimizing resource allocation and load balancing across different cloud providers while minimizing costs and latency.

Using performance metrics from multiple virtual machines (e.g., CPU usage, memory, network traffic), I built a Reinforcement Learning-based model leveraging techniques like Q-learning and Deep Q Networks (DQN).

The model continuously learned from environment feedback to make optimal resource allocation decisions in real-time. In the final stage, I deployed the solution using AWS services for performance monitoring and validation.

This work enhanced my skills in cloud infrastructure, machine learning (especially RL), and multi-cloud resource management.
